# Hey, I'm Philipp 👋  

Full-stack developer from Bavaria, Germany — working somewhere between clean frontends, smart APIs, and the occasional Docker abyss.  
I build systems that actually help people get work done — from telecom tools to restaurant maps and racing dashboards.

🧠 Self-taught coder who *once* was an industrial mechanic — so long ago it feels like another life.  
💡 Still tinkering, still learning, and occasionally breaking things just to see how they work.  
🌿 Living somewhere between code, family, and too many side projects.
